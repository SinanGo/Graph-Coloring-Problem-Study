This is a group project for Analysis of Algorithms Course prepared with (https://github.com/evrenkymt).

We tried to find an efficient way for graph coloring problem and try to implement this.

Our solution is based on matrices and very practical. 

Check projectDescription.pdf for learning what the graph coloring problem is and projectReport.pdf for our approach to 
solve it.
